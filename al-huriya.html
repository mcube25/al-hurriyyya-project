      <p>On the authority of Ibn umar who said :A man came to the prophet (S A W) and said : O messanger of Allah which of the people are most beloved to Allah and which of the actions are most beloved by Allah?
        The messanger (S A W) said: THe most beloved of the people of Allah are the most beneficient for the people,most beloved of actions to Allah are to cause happiness to reach a muslim, to relieve a muslim from hardship, to settle a debt for a muslim or to repel hunger from him. For me to walk with a brother in order to assist him is more beloved to me than to make 'itikaf in this masjid (masjid al-madinah) for a month....Whoever walks with his brother in order to assist him with a need until he has helped him completely, then Allah plants his feet firmly on the day the people will not stand firmly. Indeed bad behaviour spoils a good action just as vinegar spoils honey.</p>
